# Cats Cards
This card mod will only add high quality cards with custom effects and or weapons/gimmicks.
Now featuring the TRT Lightsaber melee weapon.
this mod has been a WIP for close to if not even more than a year

feel free to give me feedback on the mod via the rounds modding server @CatsArmy
I'm unsure of how to balance the mod at the moment but still

## My Other Projects: 
If you have ever wanted more accurate stats? then here's CatInfo this mod is an add-on to 
[TabInfo](https://rounds.thunderstore.io/package/willreuploadscuzheruinedstuff/TabInfo/).
CatInfo adds lots of stats that are all toggleable.
Most stats are disabled by default
