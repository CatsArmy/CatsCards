Important Things To Know:

ALl Melee weapons must be split into at least 2 sprites atm as you need the handle of it and the rest Otherwise you can jump on the Melee weapon forever and just fly and it causes bs.

Also to figure out how to make the weapon be postioned correctly is a bit tidieous.
you have to play with the values of the Left & Right position & scale values in the Object Mirror File.// if you are good with math and can figure out a better way for doing that please feel free to msg me about it if it worked.

thats pretty much it i tried making this as modular as possiable to make it reuseable for your other unity weapons but it needs a bit more work i cannot even lie
